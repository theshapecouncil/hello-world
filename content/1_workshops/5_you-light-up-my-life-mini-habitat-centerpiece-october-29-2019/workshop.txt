Sharing my knowledge about native plant and its importance to the ecosystem lights up my life. Join me, Weina from Poppy & Finch, learn how to create one-of-a-kind mini-habitat centerpiece using PNW native plants in a repurposed vintage lamp globe. 

Weâ€™ll learn basic planting, design composition and have fun decorating the centerpiece with rocks, moss, crystals, branches and insects or birds decorations. 

You will walk away with a centerpiece that is a perfect addition to beautify your patio while inviting all the beneficial insects out there! Last but not least, you will receive a hand-out of resources to encourage you to learn more about native plants. 

Hope it will light up your life!

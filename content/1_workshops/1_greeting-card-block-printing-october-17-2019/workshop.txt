Join Hannah Theiss at The Shape Council for a 2 hour greeting card block printmaking workshop. Block printmaking is a tactile, satisfying way of creating a design to transfer ink to paper. 

In this class you will learn:
• How to consider and plan a block design
• Use of different carving nibs to achieve different carving results
• Ink mixing and application
• Ink transfer to greeting card with a block

You will leave with:
• 8 greeting cards with your won block design
• Your original, carved block to use in future
• Go-to supplies list
• The knowledge of carving and printmaking techniques to continue to print on your own

Note: Please feel free to bring inspiration and ideas for your greeting card design. Hannah will help you translate your vision onto the block.

Join Hannah Theiss at The Shape Council for a 3 hour linocut printmaking workshop. Block printmaking is a tactile, satisfying way of creating a design to transfer ink to paper. 

In this class you will learn:
• How to consider and plan a block design with two blocks
• Use of different carving nibs to achieve different carving results
• Ink mixing and application
• Ink transfer to greeting card with a block
• registration techniques in multi-layer printmaking

You will leave with:
• 5 prints of your own 2 color design
• Your original, carved blocks to use in future
• Go-to supplies list
• The knowledge of carving and printmaking techniques to continue to print on your own

Note: Please feel free to bring inspiration and ideas for your two color block design. Hannah will help you translate your vision onto the blocks.

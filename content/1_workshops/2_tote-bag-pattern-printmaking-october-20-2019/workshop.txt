Text:

Block printmaking is a tactile, satisfying way of creating a design to transfer ink to fabric. 

In this class you will learn:
• How to consider and plan a set of square blocks to form a set of patterns
• Use of different carving nibs to achieve different carving results
• Ink mixing and application
• Ink transfer to tote bag with a block

You will leave with:
• 1 tote bag with your own pattern block design
• Your original, carved set of pattern blocks to use in future
• Go-to supplies list
• The knowledge of carving and printmaking techniques to continue to print on your own

Note: Please feel free to bring inspiration and ideas for your patterns. See images for examples of sets of block patterns. Hannah will help you translate your vision onto the blocks.

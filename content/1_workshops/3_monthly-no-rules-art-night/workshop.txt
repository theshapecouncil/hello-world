Shortdescription:

Every Third Tuesday of the month, join us for a **no rules art night**! We don't make enough time in our busy schedules to create without expectations. So now is your chance! Bring whatever supplies you want - paint, pencils, scrapbooking, origami, embroidery, anything! We will have our table, basic art supplies, and scrap materials available for use, though bringing your own supplies is encouraged. 

Pop in anytime after 6 and enjoy some casual crafting and conversation. Let your inner artist out!

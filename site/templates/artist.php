/**
 * Templates render the content of your pages. 
 * They contain the markup together with some control structures like loops or if-statements.
 * This template is responsible for rendering all the subpages of the `notes` page.
 * The `$page` variable always refers to the currently active page. 
 * To fetch the content from each field we call the field name as a method on the `$page` object, e.g. `$page->title()`.
 * Snippets like the header and footer contain markup used in multiple templates. They also help to keep templates clean.
 * More about templates: https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/basics

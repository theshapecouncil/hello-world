    <p>Sharing my knowledge about native plant and its importance to the ecosystem lights up my life. Join me, Weina from Poppy &amp; Finch, learn how to create one-of-a-kind mini-habitat centerpiece using PNW native plants in a repurposed vintage lamp globe. </p>
<p>Weâ€™ll learn basic planting, design composition and have fun decorating the centerpiece with rocks, moss, crystals, branches and insects or birds decorations. </p>
<p>You will walk away with a centerpiece that is a perfect addition to beautify your patio while inviting all the beneficial insects out there! Last but not least, you will receive a hand-out of resources to encourage you to learn more about native plants. </p>
<p>Hope it will light up your life!</p>

I design and create products that are one-of-a-kind, locally sourced and joyful. From leading creative native plant workshops for educational groups and private parties to creating products and floral designs for special events of all kinds, I want my company to be as free-form and varied as the Native landscape.</p>
